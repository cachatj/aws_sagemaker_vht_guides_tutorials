ICD-10 codes in cardiology:

I25.10 - Atherosclerotic heart disease of native coronary artery without angina pectoris: This code indicates the presence of atherosclerosis (buildup of plaque) in the native coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. However, the patient does not experience angina pectoris, which is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.

I10 - Essential (primary) hypertension: This code refers to high blood pressure (hypertension) that has no identifiable cause. It is often called "essential" or "primary" hypertension.

I48.91 - Unspecified atrial fibrillation: This code indicates the presence of atrial fibrillation, an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related complications. However, it does not specify whether the atrial fibrillation is paroxysmal (comes and goes) or chronic (persistent).

I21.4 - Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) myocardial infarction: This code is used to diagnose a type of heart attack, specifically a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In an NSTEMI, there is partial blockage of a coronary artery, leading to reduced blood flow and damage to the heart muscle.

However, in this case, the patient experiences angina pectoris (chest pain or discomfort) due to reduced blood flow to the heart.

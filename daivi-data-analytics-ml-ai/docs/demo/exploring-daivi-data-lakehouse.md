# Exploring DAIVI Data Lakehouse

## Overview

The Data Lakehouse architecture in DAIVI combines the flexibility of data lakes with the structured data management capabilities of data warehouses. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the Data Lakehouse implementations in your DAIVI environment, helping you understand how to leverage these powerful data storage and analytics solutions.

## What is a Data Lakehouse?

A Data Lakehouse is an architectural pattern that merges the best attributes of data lakes and data warehouses:

- **Data Storage Flexibility**: Store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
- **Schema Enforcement**: Apply schema when reading data, not just at write time
- **Advanced Analytics Support**: Enable machine learning, SQL analytics, and BI reporting
- **Data Governance**: Implement robust security, versioning, and auditing
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage metadata layers, indexing, and caching

## DAIVI Data Lakehouse Architecture

Our DAIVI implementation deploys four specialized data lakehouses, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. **Billing Data Lakehouse**: Centralizes AWS cost and usage data
2. **Billing CUR Data Lakehouse**: Processes detailed AWS Cost and Usage Reports
3. **Inventory Data Lakehouse**: Tracks AWS resources across your organization
4. **Splunk Data Lakehouse**: Stores and analyzes Splunk log data

Each lakehouse follows a consistent architectural pattern consisting of:

- **Storage Layer**: Amazon S3 buckets optimized for cost-effective data storage
- **Processing Layer**: AWS Glue jobs for ETL operations
- **Catalog Layer**: AWS Glue Data Catalog for metadata management
- **Query Layer**: Amazon Athena for SQL-based analysis
- **Governance Layer**: AWS Lake Formation for fine-grained access control

## Key Benefits

- **Unified Data Access**: Query data across multiple sources using standard SQL
- **Cost Optimization**: Store data efficiently based on access patterns
- **Scalability**: Process petabytes of data without infrastructure management
- **Governance**: Control access to data at multiple granularity levels
- **Analytics Ready**: Connect directly to business intelligence tools

## Data Flow

Each data lakehouse follows a similar data flow pattern:

1. **Ingestion**: Raw data collected from source systems
2. **Processing**: Data cleaned, transformed, and enriched
3. **Organization**: Data organized into logical structures (databases, tables)
4. **Discovery**: Metadata cataloged for search and discovery
5. **Consumption**: Data made available for queries, analytics, and visualization

## Security and Governance

Our implementation leverages AWS Lake Formation to provide:

- Column-level security
- Row-level filtering
- Cross-account access controls
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Exploring Individual Data Lakehouses

Each data lakehouse in our deployment has its own guide with detailed information:

- [Billing Data Lakehouse](exploring-daivi-billing.md): Understand your AWS costs across the organization
- [Inventory Data Lakehouse](exploring-daivi-inventory.md): Track and manage AWS resources
- [Splunk Data Lakehouse](exploring-daivi-splunk.md): Analyze log data and operational metrics

## Integration with Other DAIVI Components

The Data Lakehouse architecture integrates seamlessly with other DAIVI components:

- **SageMaker Unified Studio**: Access data directly for machine learning workflows
- **Amazon Athena**: Run ad-hoc SQL queries against the data
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Create visualizations and dashboards
- **AWS Lake Formation**: Manage permissions and governance

## Getting Started

To begin exploring your DAIVI Data Lakehouse implementation:

1. Review the individual lakehouse guides linked above
2. Understand the data structures and schemas available
3. Learn how to query data using Amazon Athena

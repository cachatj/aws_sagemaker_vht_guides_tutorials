###  Security Recommendations

#### a. Immediate Attention 

1. **Current SPLUNK ON EC2 is for Demo purposes and not something recommended for production use**
   - Hence it has  `verify=False` in all HTTP requests

   - **Important:** Simply changing `verify=False` to `verify=True` will break functionality in demo environments without proper certificate setup. Before implementing this change:
     - Ensure all internal certificates are valid and properly configured
     - Add self-signed certificates to the trusted certificate store
     - Establish proper CA infrastructure for internal services
     - Configure certificate chains correctly in all environments
     - Consider implementing certificate pinning for increased security
   
   For production deployment, a comprehensive certificate management strategy must be in place.

2. **Fix CORS Misconfiguration**
   - Replace wildcard CORS origin ("*") with specific trusted domains
   - Review and restrict other CORS settings (methods, headers)

3. **Address IAM Policy Permission**
   - Replace wildcard resource permissions (Resource: "*") with explicit ARNs
   - Remove excessive permissions from IAM roles and policies
   - Implement least-privilege access across all roles

#### b. Long-Term Planning 

1. **Enhance Network Security**
   - Enable VPC flow logging in all VPCs
   - Restrict default security groups
   - Disable automatic public IP assignment for non-public resources
   - Apply security group ingress/egress restrictions
   - Ensure there is inspection on North-South traffic

2. **Improve Lambda Security**
   - Deploy Lambda functions inside VPCs
   - Configure reserved concurrent executions
   - Add CloudWatch Logs permissions
   - Implement dead letter queues
   - Set appropriate timeouts

3. **Strengthen S3 Security**
   - Enable KMS encryption for all buckets
   - Configure bucket versioning
   - Implement lifecycle policies
   - Enforce TLS-only connections
   - Enable server access logging
   - Apply restrictive bucket policies

4. **Fix Error Handling**
   - Review and fix all instances of improper error logging
   - Implement consistent exception handling patterns
   - Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

5. **Implement Security Monitoring**
   - Configure CloudTrail for comprehensive API logging
   - Set up GuardDuty for threat detection
   - Implement CloudWatch alarms for security events
   - Consider AWS Security Hub for unified security view

6. **Security Testing Program**
   - Implement regular static code analysis as part of CI/CD
   - Conduct periodic penetration testing
   - Perform scheduled vulnerability scanning
   - Set up regular security reviews

7. **Security Documentation and Training**
   - Document secure coding practices for the project
   - Establish security review procedures
   - Create incident response playbooks
   - Conduct security awareness training

### 6. AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar Assessment

| Best Practice Area | Current State | Recommendations |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Identity & Access Management | Medium-Low | Remediate IAM policy vulnerabilities, implement least-privilege access, reduce wildcard permissions |
| Detection | Low | Enable VPC flow logs, implement CloudTrail monitoring, add GuardDuty |
| Infrastructure Protection | Medium-Low | Fix security group configurations, implement network segmentation, review VPC endpoints |
| Data Protection | Medium | Enable KMS encryption for all S3 buckets, fix CORS settings, implement
